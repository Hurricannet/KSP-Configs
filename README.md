# KSP-Configs
Ill just Store my personal KSP configs here, ill update them and provide links to the Mods. I also try to Put some Tutorials on KSP configs in general, and also mod Sepcific here ;)

Im still going to School, so please help me with my English so if you find any Faults here please correct it and send a Pull Request...

Sorry to everyone how hopes to Find all the mods write here but because of the Different Licenses this isnt Possible that easy ;)
I hope you like this Config Library Usefull at all :)

Most Configs are Special made for Base building and might be op, but i hope to give a somehow balanced expereince

All of those i Use myself so i see errors most the time!

Also if there are errors, even if you havent updated (doesnt matter if i get Issues which arent Issues anymore xD), send me those as Issues!

Im german so you can add Issues in German 

also some Notes may be in a mix out of English-German thing xD


FOR MOD DEVS: 

1. IF you want me to add some Configs here just send me the standart Config and ill do it
2. IF YOU DONT WANT THAT YOUR CONFIG IS IN HERE ADD AN ISSUE AND ILL REMOVE IT
3. NOT EVERY CONFIG IS EDITED!!
4. I DO NOT PUT ANYTHING IN HERE THAT ISNT AN CONFIG
5. IF SOMETHING THAT ISNT MENT TO BE AN CONFIG IN HERE ADD AN ISSUE!
